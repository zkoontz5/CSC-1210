     <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p class="news" style = "font-size: 1em">My name is Zachary Koontz, I am 20 years old and I attend High Point Univeristy.
                     I have always had a love for trucks of all kinds, I belive trucks have way more 
                     purpose then any other vehicle, as you can tow, load up equipemnt, carry multiple passangers 
                     and much more. Performance trucks became an interest to me a few years back, putting performance 
                     engines in a vehicle made for work is something i've aslways found very interesting.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Performance trucks have been around since 1925 when Ford released the Model T Runabout. 
       It wasn't until the middle 2000's when real performance pickup trucks were released. 
       With the first of it's kind being the Raptor, followed by Tesla and Ram.

   <h3>Phasing Out Gas Prefromance Trucks</h3>
   <p>In the recent years as enviormental laws stricten, gas performance trucks such as
      the Ford Raptor and the Trx have been petitioned to be phased out, Ford has even switched 
      to a hybrid motor in the Raptor (Not fully electric, but also not fully gas) </p>
